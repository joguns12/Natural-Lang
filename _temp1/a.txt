OpenAI signed a contract to purchase $300 billion in computing power over roughly five years from Oracle, people familiar with the matter said, a massive commitment that far outstrips the startupâ€™s current revenue.
The deal is one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed, reflecting how spending on AI data centers is hitting new highs despite mounting concerns over a potential bubble. It will require 4.5 gigawatts of capacity, roughly comparable to the power produced by more than two Hoover Dams or the amount consumed by about four million homes.
