If you like gift giving, view it as a gift. Find a book on something you’ve always wanted to know about, buy it like someone else got it for you, like they heard you, like they searched for it. Write notes like you’re “wrapping up” understanding and share an abridged version. You want to fall in love with research in a way that works with your existing default mode network (natural tendencies, habits, dispositions).
